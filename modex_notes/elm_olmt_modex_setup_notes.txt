###### SETUP NOTES

Step 1. Create a new work environment for running OLMT and containing the ELM model source code 

Step 2. Clone the "fasst" branch of OLMT

OLMT branch source: https://github.com/FASSt-simulation/OLMT/tree/fasst

git clone -c http.sslVerify=false -b fasst https://github.com/FASSt-simulation/OLMT

# Confirm you have the correct branch
git branch

Step 3. Download the ELM model source code. A handy script is provided in OLMT: OLMT/modex_notes 

# Go into the OLMT directory
cd OLMT

# Define your work environment and supply to the script as an argument
sh modex_notes/download_elm_source.sh /path/to/work/environment/elmlocation

Step 4. Place a copy of the cime machines files in your how working environment. A copy of the modex machines files are in OLMT.

cd OLMT
cp -r modex_notes/cime ~/.cime

Step 5. Run a basic OLMT simulation as a test
